# Recommendations on 5G system implementation and design trade-offs
## Module: 5G Data Processing (EE45GS)

## Introduction
In recent years, the development of demand for the use of the Internet and the demand of users has attracted great attention to mobile access networks. 4G, Long Term Evolution currently is not able to meet the network requirements, therefore, the development of new transmission methods with several carriers is the most attractive for the development of a 5G successor. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multi-carrier filter modulation (FBMC) are the dominant waveform candidates for fifth generation wireless communications. The cyclic prefix OFDM method (CP-OFDM), which uses the orthogonal set of subcarriers, is undoubtedly the most common multi-carrier system, but the severe requirement of this method for tight timing and synchronization requirement becomes a problem to achieve its goals [1].
